# Dota 2 lua helper
This is a helper tool which automates several aspects of Dota 2 custom game coding. It is tailored to the custom game *Dungeoneer*.
5 different aspects of this custom game are automated:
- Perks
- Encounter units
- Encounter abilities
- Modifiers
- Tooltips

Perks, Encounter Units and abilities are custom classes.
Modifiers are part of the class Encounter abilities and Tooltips are made with the help of the data of the objects.

# Concept of automation
One of the most important things I want to achieve on a project like this is automation of heavily repetitive work which otherwise would kill plenty of time. ***Why?***
- Time which is used to do repetitive work can be used to be e.g. creative instead
- While doing repetitive work concentration drops which leads to errors
- Much easier to add new objects or remove old objects afterwards
- Much easier to edit/maintain
- A solo programmer/designer has heavily limited manpower for all aspects of the game
- And.. who likes repetitive work? And who does not love automation?
